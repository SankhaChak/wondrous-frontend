# GitHub Integration

Built on top of [GitHub's SDK](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js), this library provides an easy interface for:

- querying all information for a GitHub organization
- the ability to label and update task status from Wonder
- sync logic so that Wonder's db is consistent with GitHub (_the state of truth_)
